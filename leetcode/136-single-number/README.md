## Problem

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

#### Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

#### Example 1
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:
```

#### Example 2
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
